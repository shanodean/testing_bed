# testing_bed
This is my test bed for github. I will use this repository along with terminal to learn how to create files and load/unload documents to my repository.
This hopefully going to be helpful.

I am now adding some stuff to this readme file. This is really kinda boring.
Just tried to save tje file and now I am lost.
